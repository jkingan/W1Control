# W1Control

A native application for controlling the Elecraft W1
digital wattmeter from your Mac. Will automatically scan
your available serial ports to find the W1 device.

Improvements welcome - this was just a quick hack over the
weekend so I could more accurately monitor output from a 
radio build I am working on.
